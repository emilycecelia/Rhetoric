# Quantifying Rhetoric

## Preparation
You will need:
* Python 3
* nltk
* pandas

We recommend just downloading Anaconda 3, or trying out our handy VM, Merlin!

From the Python interactive prompt, call nltk.download() and select the corpus for download.

Once you have an environment set up, you should also clone this repository into the environment.
